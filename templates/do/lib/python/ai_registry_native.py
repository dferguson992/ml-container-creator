"""Native SageMaker AI Registry helpers (BL123).

Shared, dependency-light helpers for the native `sagemaker.ai_registry` path:
datasets register natively (and, via BL117, evaluators) so they appear in Studio
Assets, while MLCC's S3 sidecar stays the durable write record. Everything here is
NON-FATAL by contract — the caller's sidecar/MLflow path must survive any failure.

Key spike-derived facts (BL122, verified against sagemaker 3.23.0):
  - The AI Registry hub is COMPUTED (`AiRegistry-<region>-<account>`), NOT
    targetable; `DataSet.create` takes no hub kwarg. We use the SDK's native hub.
  - Studio Assets visibility requires passing `domain_id` (the `@domain` tag).
  - `DataSet.create(name, source, customization_technique=<member>, role=,
    domain_id=)` keeps a `source` S3 pointer (no copy) and auto-increments the
    native semver on same-name re-create.
  - `ai_registry` + Studio Lineage are region-gated.

This module hardcodes NO per-technique knowledge beyond the single label→member
map below (Req 11.3, derive-dont-hardcode): the SDK enum is the source of the
member set, and the map is the single place MLCC's technique labels bind to it.

# ── MLCC technique label → native CustomizationTechnique member name ───────────
#
# The native `CustomizationTechnique` enum NAMES only {SFT, DPO, RLVR} (verified
# sagemaker 3.23.0). MLCC accepts a wider set of *labels* on `do/register dataset`
# and maps each to the compatible native member (Req 11):
#   - SFT, DPO           → their own member (dataset-driven techniques).
#   - RLVR               → RLVR member.
#   - RLAIF, MTRL        → the RLVR member (their training input is a prompt
#                          corpus of the same shape); the INTENDED technique is
#                          recorded in the S3 sidecar so do/tune can resolve it.
#   - benchmark          → None: sidecar-only, NOT registered natively (it is an
#                          AIPerf BYOD benchmark corpus, not a customization input).
# A value of None means "no native member" → skip the native create, keep the
# sidecar. A label absent from this map is a reward ARTIFACT or an unknown value
# and is rejected by the caller with guidance to the evaluator verbs.
